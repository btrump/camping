        <h2>Hello, lovelies!</h2>
        I've mentioned New England camping trips to all of you, and since everyone has expressed some interest, it looks like it's finally time to plan one!
        <h4>The Pitch</h4>
        A winter camping excursion over the weekend of Dec. 8, spanning the evening of Thursday Dec. 6 through Sunday Dec. 9.
        <h4>Destination</h4>
        <p>
          The Adirondack Mountains, specifically Blue Mountain Lake in Indian Lake, NY.  This campsite is quite suited to car-camping (a wonderful amenity this time of year) and is directly adjacent to the lake, affording a breathtaking view of the mountain range and the clear night sky.  Sunrise at 7:07AM, sunset at 4:28PM.
        </p>
        <h4>Gear</h4>
        <p>
          All core camping gear (tents, stoves, pots and pans, sleeping bags, blankets, pillows, long underwear) is available at my home in MA.  Groceries, extra supplies, and liquor will be procured en route from <em>Stop &amp Shop</em>, <em>Wal-Mart</em> and <em>Liquors 44</em>, respectively.  A bag of firewood is only $8, but Laura and I have enjoyed felling a tree and setting its guts ablaze.  The char also provides both a good cooking surface and an excellent walk-on-coals dare station.
        </p>
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          The goal is to secure a borrowable van or SUV to bring us all from New York, but if we lack the fortune to benefit from such largesse then a rental is the logical fallback.  In either scenario, I volunteer to do all of the driving.
        </p>
        <h4>Cost</h4>
        <p>
          Gear is entirely provided, though I suggest everyone dress in layers as it will be <em>brick</em>.  Depending on how many of us can make it, we're looking at about a $120 alcohol bill, $180 food bill, $50 in firewood, and $100 in gas, or $450/6 = $75 per person, soup to nuts.
        </p>
        <h4>Nota Bene</h4>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              I realize that Dec. 6 is on the soonish side, but we are entering the final dates that camping is even viable in the North East.  If we don't go soon, then we won't have an opportunity again until late March.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that leaving Thursday evening might be problematic for some people with inflexible work schedules.  Let me know if you're one of those people, and we'll see what can be done.
            </li>
          </ol>
